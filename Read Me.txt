Hey there! if you didnt know yet my name is Jack Warren,

I've made this python calculator open scource so feel free to download it, share it to 
anyone you meet, greet or want to defeat in maths! Just try not to edit and redistribute it as your own. 
I plan to have more features coming so stay tuned!

This Patch Brings many new things!
- Complete Overhaul and optimization to the calculator
- Now everything is defined as a function, slower initial load, faster loads after!
- Anti-Crash measures! No more having to reopen the file if you accidentally make it mad!
- Included Statistics! (Mean, Median, mode?, Variance and Standard Deviation)

  **The Above Took a VERY long time (20+ hours total with research) because im a beginner**

- Loading screen (Should only appear for a couple frames before booting)
- Includes Back to mainscreen and quit functions
-Jack should actually implement what is above fully... 

This package includes:
-Version 2.0 of the CalcOS
-Documentation for the Functions and commonly used things throughout the project
-A freindly letter from the developer
