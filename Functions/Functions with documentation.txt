But its a party for the Functions! (Refer to "commonly used.txt" for context)

Start()
Displays "CalcOS by Jack warren"
This Only appears Once above "opselect" on startup of the program after this
you shouldn't see it again.

opselect()
Displays guide text which lets you choose your desired operations.

simpleint()
Starts Simple Interest.

compoundint()
Starts Compound Interest.

genmaths()
Allows the inputs of standard maths (Add, subtract, divide, multiply, power of)
however, no brackets :'( ... yet

pythag()
Starts Pythagoras
Allows you to complete Pythagoras's theorum

delPI()
A very tasty Pi!

statistics()
Starts Statistics which is not implemented yet :(

mean()
Finds Average of a list of numbers

median()

CrashStopperPy() and CrashStopperSimpnum()
Prevents the program from closing on invalid inputs
VERY handy.

CrashHandler()
Usually seen after an "except:" at the end of a mathmatical function,
which is its natural habitat. The "except:" is caught by the "Try:" 
This prevents the OS Crashing unnexpectedly on any error within the function.
